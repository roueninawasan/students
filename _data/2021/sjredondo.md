**about_me**
>Hi! I'm Shenly, a ~~stressed~~ 3rd year BSIT student of WVSU. 
- Watching cartoons and anime movies is my favorite pastime activity. 
- I'm also a Hallyu fan and I really enjoy watching K-dramas and K-variety shows like Running Man, 2 Days and 1 Night, Sixth Sense, and many more. 
- Recently, I became a "Plantliner" and decided to grow different plants during my boring days in lockdown.
